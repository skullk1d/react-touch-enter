# README #

This demo introduces a React component _Tappable_ which uses a singleton event handler that manages all instances of components that wish to use _touchenter_ and _touchleave_ events.
I also introduce _touchhold, touchrelease, tap, tapped_

Run the demo with touch emulation or directly on a device and try tapping, holding, and dragging your finger onto and off of the boxes to see different responses for each event!

This demo runs on a react webpack boilerplate with hot reload (possibly to be released in future along with redux and react router)

*More API documentation to come...*

### How do I get set up? ###

clone, _cd_ into project and run:

* _npm install_
* _npm run dev_

Make sure the project is running on a server such as your localhost, and navigate to port 3000
